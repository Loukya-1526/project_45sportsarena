<h2>Hosting and Domain:</h2> I'm using Dashinfinity as my hosting provider because it supports WordPress, which is great for my online store. I've also chosen a domain name that fits my store perfectly.
<h2>Installing WordPress:</h2> WordPress was set up easily through Softaculous App Installer, a tool from my hosting service that simplifies the installation.
<h2>E-commerce and Other Plugins:</h2>
<b>WooCommerce: </b>This is the main plugin I'm using to transform my WordPress site into an online shop. It helps me manage products, accept payments, and ship orders.
<b>Rublon:</b> I added this for extra security, as it requires multiple steps to confirm a user's identity before accessing the site.
<b>Stripe:</b> This service processes payments on my site, making it safe for customers to pay online.
<b>Elementor: </b>This tool lets me customize and design the layout of my website.
<b>Theme Selection:</b>The team members has decided to chose the Astra theme for WordPress because it looks good on both mobiles and computers, and it works well with WooCommerce.
